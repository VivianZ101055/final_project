# I went to a session at the ARC to ask about strategies
# to approach the final project.
# I learned that on top of seeing the final html files of past projects, I could
# see how students implemented their code through a github link on each website.
# After looking through half a dozen projects, I have a better idea for what I
# want to do in terms of formatting. In particular, this map of Latin America
# interests me. I want to display remittance inflows and outflows by having a
# button on top of each country that allows the user to click and see how much
# inflow or outflow there was.
